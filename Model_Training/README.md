How to run.  

If the files aren't located inside our docker container, we need to activate a virtual environment.  
	Have the latest version of python installed.  
	Git Bash terminal into either the Manual_model or Transfer_learning folder.
	"source venv/Scripts/activate"  
	Now the virtual environment is active and we can execute our python files.  
	"python demo_file_name.py"  
	"python demo_file_name.py arguments_if_argparser"  
	When done, we need to deactivate our virtual environment.  
	"deactivate"  
	
If we are inside our docker container, we can simply run our files.  
	"python demo_file_name.py"  
	"python demo_file_name.py arguments_if_argparser"
